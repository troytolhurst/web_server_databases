# Cloud Deployment

_Coaching this? Read the coach guidance
[here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/slug/blob/main/materials/universe/distributed_applications/cloud_deployment/HOW_TO_COACH.x.md)_

In this module you will learn to:

* Explain how code goes from running on your computer to running on a publicly
  accessible server.
* Explain how continuous integration and deployment (CI-CD) is used in software
  teams.
* Deploy a database-backed web application to the cloud using CI-CD.

You will achieve these by working through a sequence of exercises and
challenges.

## Sequence

Work through each of these exercises in sequence.

### Phase One: Networking

These exercises build up your understanding of the current Internet by looking
at its history, development, and some practical tools.

1. [`ping`, and how we persuaded computers to talk](01_internet/01_ping_bite.ed.md)
2. [`traceroute`, and how we organised computers into networks](01_internet/02_traceroute_bite.ed.md)
3. [`telnet`, and how formed many connections over one cable](01_internet/03_telnet_bite.ed.md)
4. [`curl`, and how we developed common languages](01_internet/04_curl_bite.ed.md)
5. [`dig`, and how developed human-readable names](01_internet/05_dig_bite.ed.md)

/** @TODO
6. `mkcert`, and how we secured the internet 🔴
7. `docker`, and how we created the cloud 🔴
**/

### Phase Two: Wrapping up Servers

These exercises guide you through deploying a web application in a container
using Docker.

1. [Containerising a web server](02_containers/01_containerising.ed.md)
2. [Deploying a web server](02_containers/02_deploying.ed.md)

/** @TODO
3. [Connecting a container to a database](02_containers/03_connecting_to_a_database.ed.md)
**/

_Further materials on CI-CD will be added later in the week._

/**

### Phase Three: CI-CD

These exercises guide you through setting up Continuous Integration and
Deployment for a web application.

1. Continuous Integration: Running the test suite
2. Continuous Deployment: Deploying the system

### Phase Four: Building

These exercises challenge you to add more features to your application in a way
that will work in deployment.

* Adding a front-end
* Using a production web-server
* Uploading files
